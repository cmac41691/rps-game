# 🪨📝✂️ Rock Paper Scissors - JavaScript Console Game

## 🎮 About the Project
This is a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game built using **JavaScript**. It allows a user to play against the computer in a best-of-five match. The game runs in the console, randomly selecting a move for the computer while the user inputs their choice.

## 🔧 Features
- ✅ **Randomized Computer Moves** – The computer picks a move randomly each round.
- ✅ **User Input Validation** – Ensures the user selects only "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors".
- ✅ **Win/Loss/Tie Logic** – Determines the outcome of each round based on classic Rock Paper Scissors rules.
- ✅ **Best of Five Game Mode** – The game runs for **five rounds**, displaying results after each round.

## 🚀 How to Play
1. Open the **JavaScript console** in your browser or **run the script in Node.js**.
2. When prompted, enter `"Rock"`, `"Paper"`, or `"Scissor"`.
3. The computer will randomly choose its move.
4. The winner of each round will be displayed in the console.  
5. The game continues until **5 rounds** have been played.
6. The final result is displayed at the end.

## 🔦 Technologies Used 
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Node.js / Browser Console**
- **Replit / VS Code** (for development)

## 📌 How to Run the Game
### Option 1: Run in the Browser Console
1. Open `index.html` (if using an HTML file) in a browser.
2. Open **Developer Tools** (`F12` or `Right-click → Inspect → Console`).
3. Paste the script into the **Console** and press `Enter`.

### Option 2: Run in Node.js
1. Install **Node.js** if you haven't already.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the command:
   ```
   node rps-game.js
   ```

## 📝 Future Improvements (TODO)
🔹 Add a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** with buttons instead of `prompt()`.  
🔹 Implement a **scoreboard** to track wins/losses.  
🔹 Improve input handling (e.g., accept lowercase inputs like `"rock"` instead of just `"Rock"`).   
🔹 Allow the user to choose the number of rounds instead of a fixed best-of-five match.

## 💡 Inspiration
This project is part of **The Odin Project's JavaScript Foundations** assignment. It helped reinforce **functions, conditionals, loops, and user input validation**.
